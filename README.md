GoAuth2.0 is a simple [OAuth2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) server implementation written in [Go](https://go.dev/).
It does not support the entirety of the [specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) but
rather focuses on the Authorization Grant flow with the possibility of using PKCE (Proof of Key Code Exchange)
